#  DownUnderCTF 2023 - blinkybill

## Problem Statement

Hey hey it's Blinky Bill!

NOTE: Flag is case-insensitive and requires placing inside DUCTF{} wrapper!

## Information

**Point Value**: 100 points

**Category**: Miscelaneous

**Difficulty**: Beginner

## Solution

It wasn't to hard to solve, I downloaded the audio provided by the challenge 'blinkybill.wav' file. Proceeded to open it in the VLC Media Player and hear its content, where in the background could be heard a Morse Code message, so I slowed down the playback's speed to write it up. 

We get the message **-... .-. .. -. --. -... .- -.-. -.- - .... . - .-. . . ...**, which when decoded we obtain 'BRINGBACKTHETREES'.

## Flag

DUCTF{BRINGBACKTHETREES}
