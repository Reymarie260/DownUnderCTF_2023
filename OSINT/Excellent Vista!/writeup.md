#  DownUnderCTF 2023 - Excellent Vista!
## Problem Statement
What a nice spot to stop,lookout and watch time go by, EXAMINE the image and discover where this was taken.

NOTE: Flag is case-insensitive and requires placing inside DUCTF{} wrapper! e.g DUCTF{Osint_Lookout}

## Information

**Point Value**: 100 points

**Category**: OSINT

**Difficulty**: Beginner

## Solution
Downloaded image and opened it. In the gallery I searched for 'File Info' option and there it had coordenates on Location: -29.50954, 153.35957. Searched the location on Google maps, where it said the place was called the Durrangan Lookout, Australia. Placed the lookout in competition flag's format, and voilà! Flag obtained.

## Flag
DUCTF{Durrangan_Lookout}
